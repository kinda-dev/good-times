# Good Times

[Live!](http://kinda-dev.github.io/good-times)

Good Times is a platform 'side-scroller' game, featuring horizontal scrolling. The illusion of movement is given by a scrolling background while the user can have fun surfing an infinite wave with the sole purpose of avoiding random obstacles found on his path and collect 'shakas ðŸ¤™' to increase his score.

# Main developement intrest points

- Integrated Google Firebase in order to persist user scores and implemented caching so that scores only get updated when a user is in the top 5, saving many round trips to the database.
- Utilized JavaScript event listeners, CSS percentages and CSS Translate and Transform resulting in an interface that is fast, consistent across browsers, adaptive and responsive.
- Used JavaScript's requestAnimationFrame method to create an animation loop allowing objects in the game to be rerendered to create a great user experience.
